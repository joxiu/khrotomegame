     after the assassins and... uh.. fight them? You are... soldiers... of Belmark, right?\""

      that my bodyguard has been decided, is still sweating."

     keep my daughter safe or did the Council have her registered?\""

     in the Council, including me, know about the Queen's daughter.\""

     to protect you and we won't fail.\""

     this for you and you don't need to worry about these things if you don't want to.\""

     trouble. We wanted you to be hidden from the royal family because it was too dangerous.\""
