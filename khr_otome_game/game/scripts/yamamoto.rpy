    yamamoto "\"Oh, you’re here!\""
    gokudera "\"Of course I am. I can’t let you just do as you please with the princess!\""
    "Gokudera turns to me and bows his head."

    neron "\"Welcome back, [h_fname].\""
    
    h "\"Uh, thanks.\""
    "There's still tension between me and my father, but I get the feeling that
      he's at least a bit regretful for his actions."
    yamamoto "\"Whatcha cooking?\""
    "Yamamoto beats me to the punch and starts up a new topic of conversation.
      He directs me to the nearest chair, and I drop down in it with a sigh
      of relief."
    gokudera "\"Dinner for the princess. She should try some of Belmark’s trademark foods!\""
    neron "\"These are some of the foods I always had when I visited.\""
    h "\"That’s right, you guys lived there.\""
    gokudera "\"All three of you lived there in fact.\""
    "Yamamoto nudges Gokudera, unamused by Gokudera’s sudden enthusiasm in my past."
    "But it’s too late."
    h "\"Did I live there? What else was hidden from me?\""
    neron "\"It wasn’t exactly hidden… It’s just that you were two years old
      when we all moved to Namisakari...\""
    "I stand abruptly from my chair and turn to leave the kitchen."
    h "\"I’m not hungry after all.\""
    neron "\"[h_fname]!\""
    h "\"I just need to take a nap. Thanks for the thought though, Gokudera.\""
    gokudera "\"Anytime, princess!\""
    "I rush out of the kitchen and head towards my room. Maybe a good nap
      will make me feel better."

      finally see my room clearly."

    "Yamamoto jumps to his feet, an embarrassed laugh rolling out his mouth."

      for the refrigerator. He takes out a plate of food with a plastic wrap on it."
    yamamoto "\"We thought you’d be eating later but not this late. I’ll just heat it up for you.\""
    h "\"You take such good care of me.\""
    "Yamamoto chuckles at my half-truth, half-sarcastic remark."
    "Once the food is heated up, he grabs utensils for two and travels over to the table."

    "The gesture puts me at ease for some reason, as if we were just two friends conversing."

      the time, it ends up hurting both sides.\""

      have overstepped his boundaries"

      someone can relate to me right now.\""
