     cigarettes, even though he did call me an idiot right after."

     envelope out of his inner pocket. With both hands, he gruffly places
     it in my hands."

     to get violently yelled at by Gokudera."

    "Gokudera mumbles under his breath, slapping himself lightly on the cheek."
    "He grabs a compact knife out of his pocket, flipping it open. He cuts the
     middle of his palm in a horizontal line, wincing lightly at the pain."

    tsuna "\"Don’t worry, princess. It does seem a little weird, but your fingerprint
     is proof that he has sworn to protect you.\""
    yama "\"You could say that he’s protecting you with his own blood, haha.\""
    h "(How is he even thinking of laughing at a time like this?)"
    "I hesitantly place my thumb on Gokudera’s bleeding palm, hoping that it would not hurt him."

    dino "\"Haha, it’s a long story, one with a boring lineage and old people. I think Gokudera
     will fill you in about that later, I guess.\""
    "Gokudera averts his gaze to the ground away from me."
    dino "\"And with this, it’s now official. You have no use for the rest of
      us, which is a little sad in my opinion.\""
    h "\"Hahaha, aww.\""
    hibari "\"Stop pouting, herbivore.\""
    "Dino sulks further, waving his hands frantically in his attempt to deny Hibari’s claims."

    tsuna "\"That’s fine, Mukuro.\""
    tsuna "\"By the way, Mukuro is stationed at your university for now in case of any
     unexpected explosions, but he won’t intervene in the choices of your bodyguard.\""
    tsuna "\"And knowing him, he’ll probably just watch everything and you-\""
    mukuro "\"Kufufu, what did you say, Tsunayoshi-kun?\""
    tsuna "\"N-n-nothing! The rest of us will be going back to Ashworth Castle,
      we’ll keep in touch with you through Gokudera.\""
    h "\"Wait! If the castle and my mom really needed you people,
     why did you all come here? One of you should have just come here…\""
    dino "\"She wanted the best for you, and I guess she wanted you
     to choose someone you will be comfortable with.\""
    h "(Sigh, well that’s my mom for you.)"
    h "(Always putting everyone else but herself first.)"
    mukuro "\"Kufufu, and you chose that puppy of all people.\""

     they were saying, as if there was a truth to what Hibari said."

     I wish you the best in health and life.\""

    "I approach him out of curiosity."
    "From his pocket, he pulls out a couple of dynamite sticks, and places them on
     his lap. Carefully, he lines the door with dynamite, plastering it on."
    h "(Don’t tell me he’s trying to-)"
    h "\"What are you doing to the door?!\""

     has to be impregnable. I’m going turn your house into a military fortress.\""
    gokudera "\"Nothing will be going in and out of this place without notifying me first.\""
    h "\"I see. That is a very good plan, except for the fact that oh, I don’t know,
     we have to open the door multiple times to leave the house and stuff, don’t we…\""
    gokudera "\"No can do. If I had a choice, I would be placing you
     under house arrest. Nowhere is safe until he has been captured.\""
    h "(What?!)"
    h "\"So are you saying that I can’t leave my house at all?!
     I have classes tomorrow, mister-\""
    gokudera "\"Shit…I didn’t think of that possibility. Normally, the other princesses I've
     had to guard just stay at home.\""
    "He glances back at me calculatingly, as if I was the wrong answer to
     the equation he had just solved all by himself."
    "Finally, he ignores me and continues to attach the dynamite on to the door."
    "My eye twitches in annoyance."
    h "(He is really starting to get on my nerves, now.)"
    gokudera "\"You have nothing to worry about, woman.\""
    gokudera "\"The dynamite can only be ignited with my flames,
     so it’s harmless to you and your father.\""
    gokudera "\"So you can open the door freely as many times as you want.\""
    h "\"Well, that’s a relief.\""
    gokudera "\"I can’t say the same for the windows though. They’ll burst on entry.\""
    "He has a smug grin lining his lips."
    "I purse my lips, glaring daggers at the silver haired male."
    h "(Who does he think he is?)"
    h "\"Now that we’ve finished our conversation here, I’ll be in my room if you need me.\""
    "I turn away from him and attempt to leave, only to have my wrist tightly grasped, stopping me in my tracks."
    "He grits his teeth, the grip he has on my hand tightening."
    gokudera "\"Don’t leave my sight again, princess.\""
    h "(He looks furious.)"
    h "\"Okay, I won’t, jeez.\""
    "He lets go of my hand, standing up slowly. I rub my wrist slowly, gazing confusedly at him."

    h "\"You don’t have to-\""
    gokudera "\"Oi, woman. You are my responsibility now. Don’t make this harder
      and more annoying than it already is.\""

     I would lose even more of my things, haha.\""

     Do you know how uncomfortable that will be?\""
